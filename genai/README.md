* Gen AI Introduction
* Structure:
    * AI -> ML -> Deep Learning -> Gen AI
    * Gen AI is a subset of Deep Learning
    * When the output of a model is Natural Language, Image or Audio, it's GenAI
    * When the output of a model is Number, Discrete, Class, Probability, it's Not GenAI
* Basics of Deep Learning:
    * What is a model? 
        * Model is just a mathematical function
        * y = f(x)
    * Preceptron
    * Neural Network
        * Combination of mathematical functions
    * Embeddings
    * Lemmatization
    * Stemming
* Ways manipulate the model to give us correct outputs?
    * Change the biases & weights (Parameters)
    * Change the prompt itself
* Prompting
    * Anatomy of a prompt:
        1. Task
        2. (Context)System Message
        3. Examples
        4. Persona
        5. Format
        6. Tone
    * Types:
        * One Shot
        * Few Shot
* Some Topics to Explore:
    * RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
    * COT (Chain Of Thought)
    * Foundational Model
    * Transformer
    * Pre-training
    * Hallucination
* Bedrock
    * What solution does bed rock provide?
        * A standardized way to use the models from multiple vendors
    * Models Available in Bedrock
        * Light Weight Models
        * Heavy Models
    * Costs
    * Parameters:
        * Temperature
        * K
        * P
    * LangChain
        * What langchain offers?
* Guard Rails
    * Guarding througth prompts (Questions reaches the models & it responds appropriately. Eg: I can't help with that request.)
    * Guarding the model itself (Questions doesn't even reach the models.

# Project Ideas
1. Video Game NPCs:
    * Short Term Memory Loss Person: (Only one with no no memory)
    * Average Stupid Person: (Using a cheap open source model)
    * Smarter Model: (
    * Athena Employee: (Athena Documentation Stored In Vector Database)
