# How RESTFul are your REST APIs and how to measure them?

## Introduction
Web services can be fully RESTful, partially RESTful or not RESTful at all. We
are going to have a quick look at the Richardson Maturity Model in this blog.

## Richardson Maturity Model 
Richardson Maturity Model is a maturity model that classifies Web APIs.
According to the model, there are 4 levels of how RESTFul an API can be.
### 1. Level 0: The Swamp of POX(Plain Old XML)
* 
### 2. Level 1: Resources
### 3. Level 2: HTTP Verbs
### 4. Level 3: Hypermedia Controls
